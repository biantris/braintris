Hi, my name is Beatriz Oliveira a.k.a [biantris](https://twitter.com/biantris_). I'm Software Engineer. I like
and practice a lot the idea with [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) in sharing my
knowledge with other people through blog posts or articles and open source, always trying to add value to the tech or non-tech community.

I have been working for 4~ years with `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `VueJS`, `ReactJS`, `NextJS` and the related ecosystem. I also have experience developing `REST APIs` in the `NodeJS` ecosystem, with databases like `MongoDB` and `GraphQL` data query language using its `Relay` framework, focusing on products aligned with user needs.

`UI&UX` Designer with experience in mobile interfaces, desktops, posts, and systems, using `Figma` as the principal tool.
